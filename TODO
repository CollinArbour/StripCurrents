  ✔ create new naming scheme for TMB dumps @done(24-11-20 14:09)
  ☐ rename files to coincide with the naming scheme that you create @started(24-11-20 14:12)
    currently the only file that has the proper naming structure is 
    240826_HV3600 and I will structure the rest of the code around it
    for the proof of concept 
  ✔ github repo to save the files on @done(24-11-20 14:11)
    ✔ give collin co-ownership @done(24-11-21 14:39)
